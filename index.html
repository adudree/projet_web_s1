        <p> From : Planet Htrea </p>
        <p> Subject : Help </p>
        <p>
            Hello. Sorry for disturbing your use of your planet's technologies, but I must ask for your help. I am an archaeologist from Htrea.
            I found in a deep cave a mysterious machine. It looks like an ancient teleporter, with a message on a screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            It says the machine works thanks to the link between Htrea and your planet, that exist both at the same place in different universe.
            The main common point between our planets is the weather.
            If there is sun, or rain, somewhere in your home world, the corresponding place in my world is also sunny or rainy.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can activate the machine from where you are, to teleport me somewhere on Htrea. If you accept to do that, you would have to enter
            the name of a city in your interface, and the machine would translate it to send me in a place with the same weather.
        </p>
        <p> Do you want to help me ? </p>
